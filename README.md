## **Description:**

This basic RPG is where you select a character and fight the remaining characters that you could have chosen from. The difficulty in this game comes from the choices you make in who you choose to fight first.

### **Directions:**
The game begins when you choose which character to be your fighter.

You then select your first enemy from the remaining characters.

When both an enemy and player are selected press the attack button.

Each fighter has a set beginning attack value as well as a set counter attack value.

Every time you attack, your attack power grows by 4 while the enemies counter attack value stays static.

I found this assignment to be very challenging, but after I was able to get it working this was rewarding. 

If I was to go back and edit this code I would try to write this code in a more concise manner. The most obvious of these would be to organize the character objects into an array.
